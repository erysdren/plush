A neat, portable, realtime 3D rendering library originally created between
1996 and 2000 by Justin Frankel and Nullsoft, Inc.

This version has been updated with some minor modernization tweaks, including
the use of `stdint.h` and packaging through CMake and pkg-config. The original
examples have also been ported to SDL2 and SDL3.

	- None, Flat, Gouraud, Distance lightshading
- Unlimited number of cameras
	- Pitch, Pan, and Roll control
	- Target tracking
- Unlimited number of point and directional lights, each with own intensity
	- Point lights with distance falloff
- Hierarchical Objects
	- .3DS Mesh Reader
	- .COB Mesh Reader
	- .JAW Mesh Reader
	- .OBJ Mesh Reader (using [fast_obj](https://github.com/thisistherk/fast_obj/))
- Textures
	- PCX texture reader with palette optimization and auto-rescaling
	- Perspective Correct modes have piecewise linear approximation every n pixels.
- Spline interpolation with tension, continuity, and bias control
- 4x4 Matrix manipulation library
- Easy to use, cross-platform API
- Architecture that makes it simple to add new rasterizers

# TODO

- Re-work .3DS file loader to match the OBJ file loader in terms of syntax
- Add .BMP file loader
- Run `clang-format` on all source files
- Vertex colours
- Coloured lights
- Write usage docs
- Unify all examples to use main loop callbacks for better Emscripten support
- Make `SavePCX()` from `polyrobo2.c` a library API function

## CMake Configuration Variables

- `PLUSH_BUILD_EXAMPLES`: Set to `OFF` to disable building the example applications
- `PLUSH_USE_ASAN`: Set to `ON` to enable Address Sanitizer on the library and examples
- `PLUSH_MAX_LIGHTS`: Set to any numberic value defining how many lights can be
added to a scene. This value is accessible in code with the `PL_MAX_LIGHTS`
preprocessor macro. Default: 32
- `PLUSH_MAX_TRIANGLES`: Set to any numberic value defining how many triangles
can be rendered in a scene. This value is accessible in code with the
`PL_MAX_TRIANGLES` preprocessor macro. Default: 16384
